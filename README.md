# Welcome to MoneyApp

This is my first Android project, which is a basic expense tracking application. I am a person who likes to track
every spending coming out of my cards. Hence I tried to build one myself and I had a lot of fun with it.

## Screenshots

## What is working now

- User is able to add asset and transaction (with pre-set expense/income categories)
- User is able to edit/delete asset and transaction
- User is able to transfer money between assets and repay credit card
- User is able to delete transaction of transfering asset or editing asset 
- User is able to select transaction filter, including time period in month/year, transaction categories etc ..
- User is able to display spending chart of expense categories
- and more ...

## What is not working

- User is not able to register an account
- User is not able to sync data across devices
- User is not able to set their own expense/income categories
- and more ..

## Future Work

I started learning programming not many years ago and I am still a beginner. I will try my best to add more features
to this app (most of them are for my own use). Hopefully I can manage to finish it or maybe publish it someday.
